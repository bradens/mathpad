# Mathpad

Mathpad is a small extension for [Visual Studio Code] that turns a Markdown editor into an interactive scratchpad calculator.

I created this because I couldn't find a good notebook calculator that I liked that

- is free and open source,
- supports all the platforms I care about,
- works completely offline,
- supports variables and functions,
- allows you to edit anywhere (as opposed to REPL style),
- and works in and saves as plain text.

I already have [Visual Studio Code] installed on all my computers and use it for lots of text editing purposes, so I decided to make it also my calculator using this extension.
